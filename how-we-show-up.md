# How we show up

"How we show up" is Bench vernacular for the influence that a Benchmate has on the mood of a conversation. We observe "showing up" by listening to the conversations that are taking place, and assessing how each person contributed. 

## Popular models for coaching in this space

There are many popular management tools to articulate "showing up". What's interesting is that they mostly employ a strict dichotomy in their descriptions.

Carol Dweck has made the dichotomy of "fixed mindset" and "growth mindset" ubiquitous ([watch her describe them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hiiEeMN7vbQ)). In the world of tech, Satya Nadella (CEO of Microsoft) has [famously](https://www.businessinsider.com/satya-nadella-microsoft-mindset-book-2019-1) used Carol Dweck's book as the blueprint for the cultural change he has createdâ€”he describes it as __learn-it-alls__ vs __know-it-alls__.

Another popular way to describe this is the dichotomy of being "above the line" and "below the line" ([watch this video to learn more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLqzYDZAqCI)), which shares many similarities to Dweck's descriptions.

The last one I'll mention is the Drama Triangle vs the Empowerment Dynamic (AKA "Presence") ([watch this to learn more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovrVv_RlCMw&t=5s)). This model shares many ideas with the two models above, but adds characters to the story that help us understand the different roles that we can play in each world. 

## How Bench does it: Assessmemts

The three models described above are hugely instructive for how we listen to each other, especially if we're people managers listening to our reports. They give us language and examples that can help us better assess how folks are showing up, and how we can help them in future conversations.

The Bench approach is similar in its use of a dichotomy. For us, we talk about the assessments that people make. Are they assessments that open up possibilities? Or are they assessments that close them down?
