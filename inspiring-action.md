# Inspiring Action

Language is our most potent tool for both understanding and changing the world. It is deeply social: we speak—and, in the age of instant messaging, write—so that others may hear us. In turn, they speak so that we may hear them. Through these conversations we learn, we teach, and we shape the world as we know it.

In our Core Skills practice, we will be focusing on a specific subset of language: speech acts. There are five categories of speech acts: assertions, assessments, requests, promises, and declarations. We use the first two to describe the world around us. We use the latter three to change it.

In this page, we focus on the practice of making assertions and assessments. We call this skill _Inspiring Action_.

## Assertions and Assessments

_In this section, we're borrowing heavily from Peter J. Denning's [excellent article](#additional-resources) on the topic._

**Assertions** and **assessments** have multiple interpretations depending on how and when they're used. For the purposes of conversations at Bench, we will use Denning's definitions:

> ### Assertions
> Assertions are claims about what is observable in the world. They are capable of being witnessed and the witnesses can classify them as true or false. Logical propositions and statements of fact are common instances. Examples:
> - The cup is on the table.
> - Bob received an award for his work.
> - Alice stood at the doorway.
> 
> These are all assertions because they can be either true or false and they can be witnessed by observers. Note that statements about your internal state, such as:
> - I am happy.
> - I have a stomach ache.
> - She crammed knowledge into her head.
> 
> are not assertions by this definition; while they may be true for the speaker, there is no way another observer can verify them.
> A subtle but important aspect of an assertion is that it is accompanied by a commitment from the speaker to stand behind the truth of the claim and to take the consequences if it is not true. This underlying commitment is why assertions qualify as acts of speech.
> 
> ### Assessments
> Assessment are evaluations, judgments, or opinions about the world. They are claims made by the speaker, but unlike assertions they cannot be verified by witnesses. The second set of three statements listed above qualify as assessments by this definition.
> 
> Many people do not distinguish between assertions and assessments, a confusion that leads to misunderstandings and miscoordinations. You have seen this all too often when someone claims their opinion is a fact; they will often persist with their claim even when you point out that it is only an opinion. A stereotypical example is:
> - “My candidate is the best qualified for president.”
> - “That’s just your opinion.”
> - “No, it’s a fact.”
>
> An example that might occur in a team is
> - “We should do so-and-so.”
> - “Why?”
> - “Because I have more experience than you and I know from my long years of experience that it is so.”
> 
> The speaker acts as if their experience is an observable fact that trumps anything the other person might say.
> 
> Like assertions, assessments are accompanied by commitments from the speaker. This time the commitment is to stand behind the assessment, to take responsibility for it, and to deal with consequences that may follow when people act on the assessment. Assertions seek to establish what is so in the world. Assessments seek to prepare people for action.

### Grounded and Ungrounded Assessments

The vast majority of the time, when we describe the world around us, we are making assessments, not assertions. This is entirely natural—we perceive reality via our uniquely configured senses, and understand it relative to our lived experiences. We therefore tend to describe the world as it relates to us, not as a set of statements about things that can be witnessed.

Take a moment to reflect on some of the assessments you've made or heard recently with your teams (if it helps, we can use other descriptors here, like "opinions" and "arguments"). Were some of these assessments strong and inspiring? Were others weak and unconvincing? What is the cause of this difference?

This difference is rooted in the practice of _grounding_ assessments. Again, we'll get Denning's help in defining this:

> A grounded assessment is an assessment accompanied by a list of assertions that support the assessment. The purpose of grounding is to convince someone else to accept the assessment. Accepting the assessment is a prelude for action. One is unlikely to act on an assessment one does not accept.

Taking this back to your reflections above: were the assessments that you heard as "strong" and "inspiring" grounded sufficiently to prepare you to take action on them?

### Accepting Assessments

_"The purpose of grounding is to convince someone else to accept the assessment"_. It isn't enough to simply provide a list of assertions. These assertions must meet two conditions:

- *Relevancy*: the assertion(s) must be in the same domain as the assessment.
- *Sufficiency*:  the assertion(s) must satisfy criteria of acceptability imposed by the listener.

It's helpful to look at examples. First, let's look at a conversation where assertions are not relevant to the assessment:

- **Person 1**: We're experiencing an outage!
- **Person 2**: Can you tell me more?
- **Person 1**: [Another Person] can't access our software on their laptop.
- **Person 2**: What does their error message say?
- **Person 1**: There's a picture of a dinosaur, and the message says they cannot connect to the internet.
- **Person 2**: Tell them to reboot their router. This is not an outage.

Next, let's look at a conversation where assertions are relevant yet insufficient to satisfy the listener's criteria of acceptability:

- **Person 1**: We're experiencing an outage!
- **Person 2**: Can you tell me more?
- **Person 1**: We're recording elevated 500 errors in [a key system].
- **Person 2**: How do these compare to normal levels?
- **Person 1**: They are slightly higher than normal.
- **Person 2**: How long have we been recording these errors?
- **Person 1**: We went slightly over our threshold 20 minutes ago. Looking more stable now.
- **Person 2**: Let's keep an eye on this for a while before we involve the team.

Now, let's look a conversation where the assessment is grounded by assertions that convince the other speaker to accept it:

- **Person 1**: We're experiencing an outage!
- **Person 2**: Can you tell me more?
- **Person 1**: We're recording elevated 500 errors in [a key system].
- **Person 2**: How do these compare to normal levels?
- **Person 1**: They are significantly higher: they jump to about 10 times our normal levels.
- **Person 2**: How long have we been recording these errors?
- **Person 1**: 14 minutes.
- **Person 2**: I agree: we're experiencing an outage. 
_(Action follows)_

Take a moment to observe what happened here. Person 1 made an ungrounded assessment. Person 2 systematically grounds this assessment through conversation before accepting it. Now, they are prepared to take action.

Which of the two people in the conversation above did you assess as a stronger communicator? Which one is showing up as a leader? Was it the person whose conversation resulted in the assessment being grounded?

Let's look at another flavour of the same conversation:

- **Person 1**: We're recording a spike in 500 errors in [a key system]. Roughly 10 times our normal levels. This spike has been sustained for 14 minutes. We're experiencing an outage.
- **Person 2**: Agreed.
_(Action follows)_

This is a significantly more effective conversation. Person 1 provided their assertions before making the assessment. These assertions were relevant to the assessment, and met Person 2's criteria of acceptability. In this short exchange, Person 1 prepared their team for action.

Both of these conversations had the same outcome. The second conversation results in the assessment being accepted with less than half the words spoken. How different would your daily work be if your conversations were twice as effective?

Keep in mind that grounding an assessment doesn't make it true. While it is derived from observable facts, a grounded assessment is still one's interpretation of a situation, nothing more. For example, in the example above, the 500 errors could have been the result of a scheduled migration that neither person knew about. We must always remain open to more assertions, _especially_ if they disqualify our current assessments.

### Summary: Assertions and Assessments

Assertions seek to describe the world objectively. Assessments seek to describe the world in a way that prepares others for action. People must accept an assessment before they're willing to take action. For an assessment to be accepted, it must be grounded by relevant assertions that are sufficient to satisfy whatever criteria the listeners have. Therefore, when grounding assessments, we must both pro-actively provide our assertions and listen for any remaining unsatisfied criteria.

## The Effectiveness of an Assessment

_This section is deeply influenced by Carol Dweck's book,_ [Mindset](#additional-resources).

The summary of the previous section provides a strong structural understanding of assessments, how to ground them, and how to have them be accepted. What about the content of the assessment itself? Are there some assessments that are worded in a way that makes them more effective? We believe that we can measure the effectiveness of an assessment by it's likelihood to **inspire action**.

Assessments can be put into two categories: "open door assessments" and "closed door assessments". An open door assessment is an assessment that describes the world as something ready for change. An closed door assessment describes the world as something fixed or inevitable.

Let's look at an example of a closed door assessment:

- **Person 1**: I'm horribly unproductive at work.
- **Person 2**: Yeah?
- **Person 1**: I spend an average of 6 hours a day in meetings. Of these meetings, only 1 in 4 are scheduled by me.
- **Person 2**: Yikes.
- **Person 1**: I speak only occasionally in these meetings; mostly I just sit and listen. I'm _horribly_ unproductive at work.
- **Person 2**: Yeah, that sounds awful.

Person 1 makes the assessment that they're horribly unproductive at work. This is a closed door assessment: it does not provide any avenues for improvement of the situation. Person 2 commiserates, and ultimately accepts Person 1's assessment. Do you believe that this conversation is a prelude to action? Or is it a prelude for staring glumly at the wall?

What if Person 1 made an open door assessment instead?

- **Person 1**: I need to learn how to increase my participation in meetings and take control of my calendar.
- **Person 2**: Yeah?
- **Person 1**: I spend an average of 6 hours a day in meetings. Of these meetings, only 1 in 4 are scheduled by me.
- **Person 2**: Yikes.
- **Person 1**: I speak only occasionally in these meetings; mostly I just sit and listen. I _need_ to learn how to increase my participation in meetings and take control of my calendar.
- **Person 2**: How can I help?

This conversation has the same assertions as the conversation above it. The difference is that is an open door assessment: it highlights a need to learn so that improvements can follow. Person 2 accepts the assessment, and is even inspired to offer their help. Action is imminent.

### Flipping the Script

Every situation can be described with a closed door assessment or an open door assessment. Part of this skill is learning how do convert one to the other.

| Closed | Open |
|--------|------|
|This team performed poorly and didn't deliver on time.|Missing our deadline helped us identify several areas for improvement.|
|This is low quality work.|This is a great first try.|
|I can't do this!|I can't do this yet!|

So far, we've focused on assessments of "negative" situations. It's worth noting that open door assessments and closed door assessments also apply to "positive" situations:

| Closed | Open |
|--------|------|
|We're the champions!|We practiced hard all season, and tonight we were the better team.|
|This is the best sushi in town.|The chef at this restaurant keeps getting better and better.|

There's a pattern here. A closed door assessment focuses on the outcome of a situation, with no clues on how to improve it. To convert to an open door assessment, focus instead on effort put into a situation, the learning from it, and growth that will result. If we assess every situation as an opportunity for learning and growth, we will quite literally never run out of ways to improve.

### Summary: The Effectiveness of an Assessment

Any assessment (grounded or ungrounded, accepted or not) can be either an open door assessment or a closed door assessment. Open door assessments provide an actionable means for improving a situation through a focus on effort, learning, and growth. Closed door assessments provide no obvious paths to improvement because they focus purely on outcomes. If we measure the effectiveness of an assessment by its likelihood to inspire action, it is clear that open door assessments are significantly more effective because they provide clear direction on _how_ to take action.

This is why we call this skill _Inspiring Action_. It combines the discipline of grounding assessments with the discipline of speaking expansively about the future through open door assessments. This is not an easy thing to master. It requires continuous practice, and intentional reflection on past performance. We think it's worth the effort.

## Practicing this Skill

First of all, don't put too much pressure on yourself! No one in the world is able to make grounded, open door assessments every time they open their mouths. While it may seem like an individual skill, _Inspiring Action_ is actually best practiced through conversation. Often, we start with an ungrounded assessment, and collaboratively claw our way towards an accepted assessment. Sometimes, the best we can do is an ungrounded open door assessment. All of this is fine! Here's how to practice:

As you speak, and as you listen, ask yourself:
- Is this statement an assessment or an assertion?
- Is this assessment grounded?
- Do I accept this assessment/Has my assessment been accepted?
- What's missing for this assessment to be accepted?
- Is this an open door assessment or a closed door assessment?

Then, as part of your conversation, you can work towards _Inspiring Action_:

- **Ungrounded assessment:** Thank you for your assessment, can you please ground it for me?
- **Unaccepted assessment:** Here's what's missing for me to be able to accept this assessment: ____.
- **Grounded, closed door assessment:** I accept your assessment, but I don't know what to do about it. Do you see a path to positive change?

When communication asynchronously, we have the benefit of significantly more time between messages. Here, you can also practice _pro-actively_ grounding your assessments. See if you can get an assessment accepted in a single go!

Don't worry. We will also practice this as a team, _a lot_. The good news is that even a 10% improvement in this skill is a huge win. Inch by inch, we will increase our proficiency in this skill until we do it without thinking. How amazing will that be?
