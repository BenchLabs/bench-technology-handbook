# Principles in Engineering & IT

## Create Value
- We produce value only when the work that we do improves the lives of our customers.
- We do our best work when we see it as necessary to advance a cause that we believe in.
- We ensure that our work is high value by nurturing, developing and sharing so many ideas that we can’t possibly do them all, and then choosing only those with the highest impact.
- The more we learn, the greater our capacity for creating value.

## Foster Growth
- Growth happens when an individual accepts the monumental challenge of continuously asking themselves: is this the best I can do?
- To foster the growth of our colleagues—regardless of their job title—we must give them deeply honest feedback, and expect them to do the same for us.
- Feedback is most effective when those receiving it feel supported by those giving it.
- Successes and failures are important because of what we learn from them. By sharing these learnings, we rapidly increase the entire team's knowledge.

## Honour Time
- By intentionally limiting the amount of time we spend on our problems, we are adding a constraint that asks us to be continuously creative while solving them.
- Learning and doing are not separate endeavors. Within the time we allocate to a problem, we must account for both the need to deliver a solution and the need to properly learn _how_ to deliver it.	
- If we never exceed a timeline, we’ll never know how fast we can actually go.
- If we consistently exceed timelines, we’ll lose the trust of our colleagues and customers.
- Overtime is cheating. By working extra hours, you are providing a pressure relief valve on the time constraint, thereby robbing yourself of the conditions conducive - to creativity and growth.
  - Higher on the list is “taking care of your personal life”.
  - You’re be better for Bench if you are happy and health
