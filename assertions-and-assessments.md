# Assertions and Assessments

Culture is the sum of our conversations. As we have these conversations, we must ask ourselves: _is this conversation consistent with the culture I'm committed to creating?_ This page provides a framework for analyzing the structure of our conversations so we can more effectively answer this question.

_(If the above concepts are new to you, please read our page on [Culture and Principles](culture-and-principles.md).)_

## Assertion vs Assessment

Our framework has its foundation in two words: **Assertion** and **Assessment**. Both of these words have multiple interpretations depending on how and when they're used. For the purposes of analyzing conversations at Bench, we will use these definitions:

**_Assertion_**: A statement of measurable fact. _ie. The car is going 150km/h. It is -12° Celsius outside._
**_Assessment_**: A statement based on one's interpretation of the world. _ie. The car is going fast. It is cold outside._

The vast majority of the time, when we talk about the world around us, we are making assessments. This is entirely natural—we all perceive reality via our uniquely configured senses, and understand it relative to our lived experiences. However, as we pursue working in teams—creating shared understanding, building alignment, and coordinating effort—we must discipline ourselves to ground our assessments with assertions.

## Grounded Assessments

An **Ungrounded Assessment** is an assessment that has no assertions to back it up. A **Grounded Assessment** is the opposite: a statement that is can be backed up—grounded—by assertions.

It's helpful to look at examples:

- **Ungrounded:** We're experiencing an outage.
- **Grounded:**  We're registering elevated 500 errors outside of our normal range. Therefore, I'm declaring an outage.
- **Ungrounded:** You're lying.
- **Grounded:** When you spoke, your heart rate we elevated and your pupils dilated. Therefore, I believe that you're lying. 

Grounding an assessment takes effort. It is a skill that requires intentional practice. It is also something that—once you learn about it—you can't stop hearing everywhere you listen. You're welcome!

Keep in mind that grounding an assessment doesn't make it true. While it is derived from measurable facts, a grounded assessment is still one's interpretation of a situation, nothing more. In the example above, the 500 errors could have been caused by a new service that is not yet being used by the public. Or, the person speaking could have a stress disorder unrelated to the words they spoke in that moment.

Regardless, a grounded assessment is a significantly more effective tool for communicating with other people than an ungrounded assessment. When we use grounded assessments, our conversations narrow to our interpretations of a defined set of measurable things. These interpretations can be wildly different—this is great! Working through such differences can lead to tremendous growth and eventually a shared understanding of how to interpret these measurable things.

## Partially Grounded Assessments

It is rare that we can ground an assessment with all possible assertions. The vast majority of the time, we made assessments based on incomplete information. This is perfectly acceptable—the opposite is analysis paralysis. Therefore, when we make grounded assessments, it's best to assume that they are only partially grounded, which helps us to approach conversations with curiosity rather than conviction.

For example:

- **Person 1**: That blue car is going 150km/hr on a city street. It is driving dangerously and should be impounded.
- **Person 2**: The road is closed for a race, that blue car is a race car capable of going 300km/hr, and it is in last place by 35 seconds.
- **Person 1**: Ah. That explains all the fences. Hit the gas, blue car!

## Assessments that Create Possibility

Up to this point, we've focused primarily on the structure of an Assessment. Now, we'll look at the content.

Any assessment—grounded or ungrounded—has the potential to either create or reduce possibility. Again, this is best described through examples:

- **Grounded/Creates Possibility**: We've missed the past 2 deadlines, and in both cases we learned from our mistakes. We're working on an unfamiliar problem, but that's something we do all the time. This team is capable of hitting this deadline.
- **Grounded/Reduces Possibility**: We've missed the past 2 deadlines and we're working on an unfamiliar problem. I think it is unlikely that we will hit this deadline.
- **Ungrounded/Creates Possibility**: We're going to make this deadline!
- **Ungrounded/Reduces Possibility**: There's no way we'll ever finish this on time.

There is a hierarchy of assessments here:

1. Grounded Assessments that Create Possibility—Gold standard. Leaders live here.
1. Grounded Assessments that Reduce Possibility—We've got good stuff to work with.
1. Ungrounded Assessments that Create Possibility-Feels good, and we _might_ get lucky.
1. Ungrounded Assessments that Reduce Possibility-Potentially toxic and often self-fulfilling.

## Practicing with this Framework

First of all, don't put too much pressure on yourself. No one in the world is able to make grounded assessments that create possibility every time they open their mouths. Often, we start at the bottom of the hierarchy and slowly claw our way upwards. Sometimes, the best we can do is an ungrounded assessment that creates possibility. All of this is fine!

Conversations are a collaborative effort. As we speak, and as we listen, we can ask ourselves:
- Is this statement an assessment or an assertion?
- Is this assessment grounded?
- Does this assessment create or reduce possibility?

Then, as part of the conversation we're having, we can work our way up the hierarchy of assessments through thoughtful questions.

- **Ungrounded Assessment:** Thank you for your assessment, can you please ground it for me?
- **Grounded Assessment that reduces possibility:** Thank you for your assessment. Based on these assertions, do you see a path to success?

## A Tricky Example

Beware the assessment disguised as an assertion! They are very common. Let's work through an example:

> This meeting is a waste of our time.

This is an ungrounded assessment that reduces possibility of this meeting being successful. It is also phrased as an assertion. If you encounter one of these, here are some questions you can ask:

- You sound as though you're speaking on behalf of everyone in the meeting. Can you assert that everyone agrees with you?
- What expectations did you have for this meeting? In what ways are we missing them?
- What would you recommend we change so that this meeting is a better use of your time?

Tone is everything here. The above questions need to be asked from a place of curiosity. They are an invitation to help the speaker move up the hierarchy of assessments to a place of shared understanding on how we can improve things. If these questions are weaponized, they will not be effective in creating powerful conversations, and they will be inconsistent with our culture.

## Next steps

The ability to identify where a statement is in the hierarchy of assessments is a huge win. The next step is to practice creating conversations that move up the hierarchy. This is a core skill across all our conversations. It is particularly important as part of another skill that we call Embracing Dissatisfaction—training on that coming soon!
