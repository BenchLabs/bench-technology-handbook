# How we make commitments

At Bench, we have lots of conversations. These conversations are frequently about how we want to improve things. So how do we make sure that things _actually happen_ as a result of these conversations? We make commitments.

Making Commitments is not a natural phenomenon. It requires practice, and it's okay if it feels awkward at first. We've built this page as a reference to help you with your practice.

## Commitment flowchart

We've built a [flowchart](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lwSXARg=/) to illustrate how commitments happen at Bench works. We recommend familiarizing yourselves with this it, and then using this page as a reference for the terms themselves.

## Terms

**_Dissatisfaction_**: A general belief that things can be better than they are. In the real world, "dissatisfaction" often has negative connotationsâ€”but not at Bench. Dissatisfaction is the requisite first step for any change, big or small. Glory in it!

**_Concern_**: Very closely related to dissatisfaction, but often related to the perceived downsides of what you are dissatisfied with. Often looks like "I am concerned that because of situation X, thing Y will happen." As an individual, you can analyze your concerns to find your dissatisfaction. As a leader or collaborator, you can listen to concerns and dig in to find the underlying dissatisfaction.

**_Satisfaction_**: The opposite of dissatisfaction. You're happy with how things are. Just don't be satisfied to _too_ long.

**_Conditions of Satisfaction_**: What needs to be true for you to be satisfied?

**_Request_**: Ask someone to do something in order to meet your conditions of satisfaction. _Needs to be accepted to become a promise._

**_Offer_**: Offer to do something for someone in order to meet your (or their) conditions of satisfaction. _Needs to be accepted to become a promise._

**_Counter offer_**: If you can't say yes to a request or offer, what can you do instead?

**_By when_**: The date you're committing to completing a promise/commitment.

**_Commitment/Promise_**: Commitments AKA Promises are how we talk about the future we're creating in concrete terms. They have three key components: "what we're doing", "for whom", and "by when". *Important*: Promises are not a tool to be weaponized if a promise can't be kept. Yes, they are the most concrete tool we have for talking about the future, but it's still _the future_. We learn, we uncover, variables change: when this occurs, we must re-promise in order to once again communicate our most accurate version of the future.

**_Commit-to-commit/promise-to-promise_**: Neat little trick for when someone asks you a "by when" and you don't know yet. Looks like this: "I will commit to commit about that by [some date]". 

**_Re-commit/Re-promise_**: When you can't keep the promise you made, you'll need to make a new one (or toss the whole thing in the bin).
