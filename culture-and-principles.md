# Culture and Principles

## What is culture?

What is culture? How do you point at a company and say: "this is their culture"? Can you look back at a period of time and understand how it influenced culture? If you don't like a culture, can you change it? How do you hire for "culture"?

Culture can feel ambiguous, intangible, and inaccessible. Fortunately, it isn't.

You can read, listen to, type, speak, and think the culture of an organization. It's right there, in the conversations that are taking place every single day. Every Slack message, every watercooler session, every Jira comment, every 1:1, every all-hands, every line of code; they are all conversations that we're having or have had. Culture is simply the sum of all of these conversations.

With this mental model, we have no choice but to accept that every single person who works here is actively creating our culture every single day, _every time they have a conversation_. No one is spared this responsibility! So what do we do with it?

## Culture creators

We've all been culture creators our entire lives, whether we knew it or not. Here's an example:

_You're at the pub with a group of friends, having a casual chat, when one of the people at the table 
participates in the conversation by saying something inappropriate. 
There is a pause, where everyone says to themselves: "do I say something?"
If nothing is said, the inappropriate conversation is deemed to be acceptable (at least by the perpetrator), and they may continue to act the way they've acted.
If something is said, the opposite occurs: a culture of standing up for a moral code is solidified, and the perpetrator will either need to change their ways, or find another table._

If we think of culture as the sum of all conversations, we can sketch this out as a formula:

```
If no one says anything:

  All the conversations we've had 
+ the inappropriate thing that was said 
= our culture

If someone says something:

  All the conversations we've had 
+ the inappropriate thing that was said 
+ a conversation about how that comment isn't acceptable 
= our culture
```

It's that simple: one conversation changes the culture, and another may correct its course.

So, as culture creators, it is up to us to observe the conversations that we're part of. We must then ask ourselves: "are these conversations consistent with the culture I'm committed to creating?" If they aren't, it's up to us to make sure our subsequent conversations put us back on track.

## Culture at scale with principles

At the time this is written, Bench has over 700 employees distributed across North America. At this scale—in order to be able to ask ourselves "are these conversations consistent with the culture I'm committed to creating?"—we must explicitly define our culture. This is why we have cultural principles.

First, let's look at the Bench Principles:

- Customer Obsession
- Ownership
- Empathy
- Empowerment
- Transparency

_We recommended taking a [deep dive](https://bench.co/go/culture/) if you aren't yet familiar with these principles._

These principles are designed to describe the _how we do it_ aspect of our culture. They intentionally read like instructions, and are broad enough to apply to everything you do at work: writing an email, messaging a colleague, brainstorming with your team, commenting on a document, etc.

You can think of the five principles as the boundaries for conversations that are consistent with our culture. If a conversation exists within the boundaries of these principles, it is consistent with Bench's culture.

## _What we do_ in Engineering

In Enigneering, we love the Bench Principles, but we felt there was something missing. Specifically, we wanted to define _what we do_ in addition to _how we do it_. To achieve this, we decided to write our own, organization-specific principles.

### How we created the Engineering Principles

#### Step 1

We wrote down what dissatisfied us about our existing culture, and grouped these statements of dissatisfaction into themes.

For example, there was a theme around feedback and learning:
- Talking to people about their growth often feels like pulling teeth—everyone would rather talk about their project work
- Individuals are afraid of uncomfortable conversations—some would rather quit their job that have them
- When feedback is given, it can do more harm than good because either the person giving feedback isn't doing it constructively or the person receiving it isn't emotionally ready to listen

#### Step 2

For each theme, we described aspects of a culture that we would prefer to what we're currently seeing. We took these ideas, grouped like concepts together, and wrote them in list format. This list was our first draft of the culture we wanted to create.

Using the example above, the list for the "feedback and learning" theme was:
- We have consistent, TWO-WAY conversations about growth with our reports
- Team members understand the transformational power that difficult/scary/uncomfortable conversations can have
- We have trained our team to give feedback in a way that helps others receive it

#### Step 3

We phrased the list items as axioms. Where possible, we wrote axioms that covered multiple list items.

> Axiom: a statement which is accepted as self-evidently true.

The discipline of creating axioms forced us to be very specific in defining the building blocks of the culture we wanted to create. The number of axioms in each theme is small, but when read as a group they evoke a beautiful, complex vision for what our culture can be.

Continuing our example, the axioms for the "feedback and learning" theme became:
- Growth happens when an individual continuously asks themselves: is this the best I can do?
- To grow, we must step into conversations that feel scary and uncomfortable.
- Feedback is most effective when those receiving it feel supported by those giving it.

#### Step 4

For each theme, we defined a principle that we believed would result in the culture defined in each set of axioms.

For the "feedback and learning theme", we decided that "Foster Growth" is the instruction most likely to help people achieve the culture defined by the theme's axioms.

## The Engineering Principles

Our work resulted in four principles:

- Create Value
- Foster Growth
- Succeed Together
- Build Agility

Learn more about our Engineering principles [here](https://github.com/BenchLabs/bench-technology-handbook/blob/master/technology-principles.md). 


When we have conversations about _Creating Value_, _Fostering Growth_, _Succeed Together_, and _Build Agility_, we must ensure that they live within the boundaries set by _Customer Obsession_, _Ownership_, _Empathy_, _Empowerment_, and _Transparency_.
