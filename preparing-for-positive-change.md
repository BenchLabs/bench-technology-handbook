# Preparing for Positive Change

As team members, one of the most critical things we can do is effectively describe the world around us. We do this to create a shared understanding of _what is happening_ so that we can decide _what to do about it_. Creating shared understanding cannot be done alone; it is a group activity, surfaced through conversation.

In this page, we introduce two concepts. The first, _Assertions & Assessments_, teaches us how to use conversations to prepare our teams for action. The second, _Above/Below the Line_, helps us approach the world with deep empathy, responsibility, and willingness to grow. When put together, these result in a skill we call _Preparing for Positive Change_.

## Concept #1: Assertions and Assessments

_In this section, we're borrowing heavily from Peter J. Denning's [excellent article](https://denninginstitute.com/pjd/TT/AssertAssess.pdf) on the topic._

_Preparing for Positive Change_ has its foundation in two words: **Assertion** and **Assessment**. Both of these words have multiple interpretations depending on how and when they're used. For the purposes of conversations at Bench, we will use Denning's definitions:

> ### Assertions
> Assertions are claims about what is observable in the world. They are capable of being witnessed and the witnesses can classify them as true or false. Logical propositions and statements of fact are common instances. Examples:
> - The cup is on the table.
> - Bob received an award for his work.
> - Alice stood at the doorway.
> 
> These are all assertions because they can be either true or false and they can be witnessed by observers. Note that statements about your internal state, such as:
> - I am happy.
> - I have a stomach ache.
> - She crammed knowledge into her head.
> 
> are not assertions by this definition; while they may be true for the speaker, there is no way another observer can verify them.
> A subtle but important aspect of an assertion is that it is accompanied by a commitment from the speaker to stand behind the truth of the claim and to take the consequences if it is not true. This underlying commitment is why assertions qualify as acts of speech.
> 
> ### Assessments
> Assessment are evaluations, judgments, or opinions about the world. They are claims made by the speaker, but unlike assertions they cannot be verified by witnesses. The second set of three statements listed above qualify as assessments by this definition.
> 
> Many people do not distinguish between assertions and assessments, a confusion that leads to misunderstandings and miscoordinations. You have seen this all too often when someone claims their opinion is a fact; they will often persist with their claim even when you point out that it is only an opinion. A stereotypical example is:
> - “My candidate is he best qualified for president.”
> - “That’s just your opinion.”
> - “No, it’s a fact.”
>
> An example that might occur in a team is
> - “We should do so-and-so.”
> - “Why?”
> - “Because I have more experience than you and I know from my long years of experience that it is so.”
> 
> The speaker acts as if their experience is an observable fact that trumps anything the other person might say.
> 
> Like assertions, assessments are accompanied by commitments from the speaker. This time the commitment is to stand behind the assessment, to take responsibility for it, and to deal with consequences that may follow when people act on the assessment. Assertions seek to establish what is so in the world. Assessments seek to prepare people for action.

### Grounded and Ungrounded Assessments

The vast majority of the time, when we talk about the world around us, we are making assessments, not assertions. This is entirely natural—we all perceive reality via our uniquely configured senses, and understand it relative to our lived experiences.

Take a moment to reflect on some of the assessments you've made or heard recently with your teams (if it helps, we can use other descriptors here, like "opinions" and "arguments"). Were some of these assessments strong and inspiring? Were others weak and unconvincing? What is the cause of this difference?

This difference is rooted in the practice of _grounding_ assessments. Again, we'll get Denning's help in defining this:

> A grounded assessment is an assessment accompanied by a list of assertions that support the assessment. The purpose of grounding is to convince someone else to accept the assessment. Accepting the assessment is a prelude for action. One is unlikely to act on an assessment one does not accept.

Taking this back to your reflections above: the assessments that you heard as strong and inspiring were likely grounded sufficiently to prepare your team to take action on them. Note that simply providing a list of assertions with an assessment is insufficient. To ground an assessment (and therefore inspire the listener to prepare for action) its accompanying assertions must meet two conditions:

- *Relevancy*: the assertion(s) must be in the same domain as the assessment.
- *Sufficiency*:  the assertion(s) must satisfy criteria of acceptability imposed by the listener.

It's helpful to look at examples. 

First, let's look at a conversation where assertions are not relevant to the assessment:

- **Person 1**: We're experiencing an outage!
- **Person 2**: Can you tell me more?
- **Person 1**: [Another Person] can't access our software on their laptop.
- **Person 2**: What does their error message say?
- **Person 1**: There's a picture of a dinosaur, and the message says they cannot connect to the internet.
- **Person 2**: Tell them to reboot their router. This is not an outage.

Next, let's look at a conversation where assertions are insufficient to satisfy criteria of acceptability:

- **Person 1**: We're experiencing an outage!
- **Person 2**: Can you tell me more?
- **Person 1**: We're recording elevated 500 errors in [a key system].
- **Person 2**: How does these compare to normal levels?
- **Person 1**: They are slightly higher than normal.
- **Person 2**: How long have we been recording these errors?
- **Person 1**: We went slightly over our threshold 20 minutes ago. Looking more stable now.
- **Person 2**: Let's keep an eye on this for a while before we involve the team.

Now, let's look a conversation where the assessment is grounded in a way that convinces the other speaker to accept it:

- **Person 1**: We're experiencing an outage!
- **Person 2**: Can you tell me more?
- **Person 1**: We're recording elevated 500 errors in [a key system].
- **Person 2**: How does these compare to normal levels?
- **Person 1**: They are significantly higher: there's a big, sudden spike.
- **Person 2**: How long have we been recording these errors?
- **Person 1**: 14 minutes.
- **Person 2**: I agree: we're experiencing an outage. Let's alert the team.

Note that in the conversations above Person 2 comes across as a leader, and Person 1 doesn't. This is because Person 2 is relentless in gathering assertions before making their own assessment. Person 1 would show up very differently if they had grounded their initial assessment:

- **Person 1**: We're recording a sudden, big spike in errors in [a key system]. This spike has been sustained for 14 minutes. I'm declaring an outage.
- **Person 2**: Agreed. Let's alert the team.

This is a significantly more effective conversation. By grounding their assessments without, Person 1 is preparing their team for action—this is an effectiveness in communication that we expect from strong leaders.

Keep in mind that grounding an assessment doesn't make it true. While it is derived from measurable facts, a grounded assessment is still one's interpretation of a situation, nothing more. For example, in the example above, the 500 errors could have been the result of a scheduled migration that neither person knew about. We must always remain open to more assertions, _especially_ if they disqualify our current assessments.

### Summary

Assertions seek to describe the world objectively. Assessments seek to describe the world in a way that inspires action. For an assessment to inspire action from others, it must first be accepted by them. For an assessment to be accepted, it must be grounded by relevant assertions that are sufficient to satisfy whatever criteria the listeners have. Therefore, when grounding assessments, we must both pro-actively provide our assertions and listen for any unsatisfied criteria.

## Concept #2: Above/Below the Line

![A black line with a location icon above it](images/the-line.png)

The above image shows a very popular coaching tool: the idea of your internal "location" relative to a simple black line. There are two places you can be: above the line, and below the line. If you are above the line, you are experiencing the world with wonder, joy, inclusivity, a willingness to learn from mistakes, and a deep sense of ownership and responsibility. If you are below the line, you are experiencing the world with doubt, anxiety,  fear of making mistakes, and a tendency to blame others or make excuses for how things are. When you're above the line, you're focused on being curious. When you're below the line, you're focused on being right.

![A black line with words that describe above and below the line around it](images/the-line-complete.png)

We all live on both sides of the line. That's what it is to be human. Indeed the oldest parts of our brain are _hardwired_ to place us below the line to ensure our survival in the event of a threat. The problem is that they can't differentiate  a threat to our person from a threat to our ego.

We must therefore engage in the practice of asking ourselves whether we are above the line or below the line in any (non-threatening) situation. Being below the line isn't a bad thing, but it is an important to recognize—when you're below the line, you're not in a place where you can be a great teammate or leader. Your location relative to the line will show up in your mood, your physicality, and your conversations—particularly in the assessments that you make.

If you find yourself describing the world from below the line, it's a perfect time to take a breath, and either relocate yourself or remove yourself until you can.

## Making assessments from above the line

Grounded assessments prepare us for action by creating alignment about the way things are. We believe that if these assessments are made from above the line, they are significantly more likely to result in positive change than assessments made from below the line.
