# How to quit

We don't expect people to work at Bench forever. That's not how life works in the modern era. What we hope for with every hire is that they will see tremendous growth, and through their growth they will leave Bench significantly better than they found it.

Our aspiration is that folks who work with us see potential for longterm employment and continuous growth. However, sometimes folks determine that they will grow better in a different environment. _That's okay_. One of the big reasons we're writing this guide is to de-stigmatize conversations about leaving Bench.

As leaders, there are a number of things we look for in a "good" quit:

1. We aren't surprised

Your manager is here first and foremost to help you grow, regardless of where that growth may take you. If you let us know you're planning on leaving, be it in 1 month or 12, your manager is going to do two things: (1) support the heck out of you in achieving the goal that takes you out of Bench, and (2) invest in your development at Bench just as much as they would otherwise, so that when you do leave, you've accomplished a lot AND that we make it hard to go because you're having such a great time.

2. Your team will be fine without you

If you're a critical part of a team delivering a piece of technology on a deadline, consider departing after the deadlineâ€”trust us, the start date at your new job is flexible. Similarly, if you have a lot of knowledge that only exists in your head, make sure that it is written down, and ideally train someone to be the new owner of that piece of the puzzle.

3. (For leaders) There is an obvious internal candidate for succession

One of the most powerful things a leader can do is to build a team so strong that they're barely needed anymore. This often comes from leveling up one or several team members to a place where they could take on the team themselves. As a leader, if you leave Bench, you should be able to name a successor on your team.

_That's it._ After that, it's about getting the most out of your remaining time, and thanking you for what you've contributed thus far. We could not have gotten to where we are without your help.
