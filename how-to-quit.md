# How to quit

As managers, we do everything in our power to create a work environment that folks want to stay in. Sometimes, folks decide they'd rather work elsewhere. _That's okay._ If you find yourself in this situation, we have a two requests:

1. Don't keep it a secret! 

Have a real conversation with your manager about where you're at. Maybe there's a conversation we can have that changes your your mind. If not, maybe we can support you in seeking your next role. Regardless, it's hugely beneficial for us to see Bench through your eyes so we can continue to improve.

2. Respect your teammates and their commitments. 

If you're working towards a commitment that your departure would impact, take that into account before setting any timelines. If you're a manager or more senior in general, consider a longer notice period (1 month+) so that we can facilitate a smooth transition.

_That's it._ After that, it's about getting the most out of your remaining time, and thanking you for what you've contributed thus far. We could not have gotten to where we are without your help.
