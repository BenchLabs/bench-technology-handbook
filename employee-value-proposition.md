# Employee Value Proposition (EVP)

When you work at Bench, you get more than just a paycheck. You get a great work environment, full of people who are genuinely interested in your wellbeing and your growth. You get office parties, kudos, and snacks. You get a network. You get people who challenge and inspire you. All these things add up to what we call the Employee Value Proposition (EVP). 

The components of the EVP can be broken into three categories: Compensation, Engagement, and Growth.

## EVP Metaphor

Picture three rivers. These rivers represent the three types of investment a business can make in an employee:  Compensation, Engagement, and Growth. The size of each river depends on the culture and priorities of the business. Some companies have a torrent in Compensation and trickles in Growth and Engagement—think oil rigs in the North Sea. Some invest hugely in Engagement and Growth because they can’t afford high Compensation—think NGOs and print journalism.

These rivers are flowing down a mountain into a lake. The water in the lake represents the ongoing investment that a business is making in an employee. When a business makes this  investment, it’s making a bet that it will yield returns in the form of business value. In effect: investment in an employee can be seen as _potential_ business value.

On the far side of the lake is a hydroelectric dam. The dam represents work—the conversion of employee investment into business value. Within the dam are turbines, which represent the core competencies of the employee’s role. The speed with which each turbine spins is determined by the ability and effort of the employee. Faster turbines generate more electricity. They also require more water.

It is the job of the manager to encourage maximum output from the dam relative to flow from the rivers. If the dam is generating so much electricity that water levels struggle to keep up, it’s a sign that we need more water from our rivers—an increased investment in Engagement, Growth, or Compensation. It may also be a sign that we need bigger and/or additional turbines—a promotion. Conversely, if water levels rise beyond the dam’s capacity, we’re pouring investment down a spillway.
