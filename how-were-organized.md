# How we're organized

[![Overview of how the Technology Teams are organized](images/Technology-Team-Structure.jpg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/BenchLabs/bench-technology-handbook/master/images/Technology-Team-Structure.jpg)

The Technology Organization is made up of two departments: Business Technology (BizTech) and Product Engineering (Prod Eng). Each department is made up of multiple teams, and each team has a specific mandate. We also work very closely with Product and Design—you'll often hear us using the acronym TPD to describe our working group, which stands for Technology, Product, and Design.

This document is written to help you understand what each of these teams does. For a deep dive on how we think about investment across all teams, see [How we invest our time](how-we-invest-our-time.md).

## Technology Leadership

The Technology Leadership group is made up of our VP, our Directors, our Principal Engineer, and our Manager of Technology Culture Systems. The members of this team are the stewards of our Technology Culture, and work together to build systems that enshrine our principles.

## BizTech

The Business Technology group exists to support the implementation, creation, and use of technology across Bench. The group's primary function is KTLO (Keeping The Lights On) and Support; indeed many of the BizTech teams use JIRA support desk to manage the support requests that they receive. It is made up of the **IT**, **Data**, **Platform**, **Bench Application Support (BAS)**, **Support Engineering**, and **Developer Experience and Impact (DXI)** teams.

### IT

The IT team owns and supports our physical infrastructure (wifi, on-prem VPN, laptops, etc) as well as the administrating and maintaining access control to various software. They are also responsible for onboarding, offboarding, and a significant amount of our security controls.

### Data

The Data team owns our data pipelines and warehouse. They create the data infrastructure required for us to make business decisions with ever-increasing speed and accuracy, and lead data analysts across Bench in adopting better technology and practices to accomplish this. They test their data infrastructure and processes by serving the Product team directly as analysts, and by filling any gaps in reporting and analysis that emerge from requests of analysts outside the Data team.

### Platform

The platform team own our cloud infrastructure including securing it. This team builds and maintains the interfaces that Benchmates use to create value for our customers, and they play a big role in enabling Product Engineering, IT, and Data with infrastructural support and guidance.

### Business Operations Support (BOS)

BOS is focused on the health of our CRM and the various tools that integrate with it. They triage and respond to issues with our Salesforce instance and empower our go-to-market teams through both education and filling gaps in our current Salesforce environment.

### Bench Application Support (BAS)

BAS triages internal and external bug reports. They're experts in our applications, and regularly provide help and training to empower other Benchmates. Increasingly they're taking on other functions, like QA, site updates, and compliance. They work closely with Sup Eng to respond to incidents and prioritize which feature requests create the most value for Bench.

### Support Engineering (Sup Eng)

Support Engineering's primary concern is KTLO in our application, balancing their remaining capacity between supporting other teams at Bench with features that are too small for the roadmap and innovating to make both KTLO and supporting other teams at Bench more efficient. Sup Eng and BAS work together to handle crises when they occur, pulling in other BizTech teams or Product Engineering if needed.

### Developer Experience and Impact (DXI)

The DXI team is focused on tools, frameworks, techniques, practices, and systems that help bring joy to the software development experience. Their goal is to reduce any negative impacts, friction, and pain that our engineers experiencing while building our software, while improving things like application security and developer productivity.

## Product Engineering

The Product Engineering team works closely with Product and Design to build technology that creates growth opportunities for Bench. This can be in the form of new products, or in improvements to existing products and workflows. They are key players in executing both our Technical and Product Roadmaps.

### Teams & Work Streams

_Work Stream: A time-bound area of investment. ie. Bookkeeper Efficiency, Self-Serve Onboarding_

There are currently 6 teams in Product Engineering. Each of these teams focus on one work stream at a time. Work streams are long-lived, generally 6-18 months. The teams are made up an Engineering manager, a Product Manager, a Designer, and several Product Engineers.

## Design

The Design team is asked to concretely point toward a future that doesn’t exist yet. They work closely with the Product team to deeply understand problems, and with the Product Engineers to deeply understand potential solutions, and use that understanding to define in real terms how the next thing we build will work and what it will look like. They work directly alongside engineers in the Focus track to bring these solutions into reality.

## Product

The Product team is asked to deeply understand our domain, our clients, and our business strategy. They are experts in distilling the problems our clients face, and for suggesting innovations that solve or reduce these problems. They work closely with Design and the Product Engineers.
