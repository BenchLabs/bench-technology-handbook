# Product Engineering and BizTech

The Technology organization is made up of two groups: **Product Engineering** and **BizTech** (Business Technology).

## Product Engineering

The Product Engineering group owns and develops our client applications and the internal tools for our operations teams. This team is the largest component in Bench's investment in product innovation. Functionally, the group has two tracks: **Focus** and **Flex**.

**Focus**

The Focus track works in build cycles based on the model described in [Shape Up](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/webbook). This system optimizes for two things. First, it ensures that that what we're working on _right now_ aligns with Bench's strategy. Second, it ensures the creation of value on a regular cadenceâ€”projects aren't allowed to take longer than the build cycle. How it works:

Every 8ish weeks the Product team (in collaboration with Engineering and Design) submits pitches for projects for the coming cycle, and senior leaders bet on the ones that they believe will have the biggest impact for our clients. The engineers (in collaboration with Product and Design) then spend 6 focused weeks on the projects that were chosen, and deliver the maximum value that we can within this timeframe. This is followed by 2 weeks of cooldown to handle the various maintenance, refactors, and improvements that have been tabled for the previous six weeks. If a project isn't finished, it can be re-bet upon in the coming cycle.

**Flex**

The Flex track is the KTLO/Support function of the Product Engineering Group (See [How we invest our time](how-we-invest-our-time.md)). The Flex track works closely with BAS (Bench App Support) and BizTech to handle the issues, outages, and stakeholder requests that come our way during a cycle and its cooldown. In effect, the Flex track makes the Focus track _possible_ by absorbing the myriad distractions the team needs to deal with during a cycle. The number of engineers on the Flex track scales based on total number of clients, a proxy for business complexity.

## BizTech

The Business Technology group exists to support the implementation, creation, and use of technology across Bench. The group's primary function is KTLO and Support; indeed many of the BizTech teams use JIRA support desk to manage the support requests that they receive. It is made up of the **Platform**, **Data**, **IT**, and **Bench App Support** teams.

**Platform**

The Platform team owns our cloud infrastructure, our build pipeline, and our development environment. They play a big role in enabling Product Engineering, IT, and Data with infrastructural support and guidance. 

**Data**

The Data team owns our data pipelines and warehouse. They create the data infrastructure required for us to make business decisions with ever-increasing speed and accuracy, and lead data analysts across Bench in adopting better technology and practices to accomplish this. They test their data infrastructure and processes by serving the Product team directly as analysts, and by filling any gaps in reporting and analysis that emerge from requests of analysts outside the Data team.

**IT**

The IT team owns our physical infrastructure (wifi, on-prem VPN, laptops, etc) as well as the access to our software (think Okta, Salesforce, etc). They are responsible for onboarding, offboarding, and a significant amount of our security controls.

**BAS (Bench Application Support)**

Bench Application Support handles all internal and external bug reports, questions, and stakeholder requests. They're also experts in our applications, and regularly provide help and training to unblock other Benchmates. Increasingly they're taking on other functions, like QA and security compliance.

_NOTE: Bench App Support actually reports into Operations, but they're a key contributor to BizTech's success_
