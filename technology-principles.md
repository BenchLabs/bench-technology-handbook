## Create Value
- The speed at which we learn is the most important factor in our ability to create value.
- We are most likely to do high-value work when we see it as necessary to advance a cause that we believe in.
- We ensure that our work is of high value by nurturing, developing and sharing so many ideas that we can’t possibly do them all, and then choosing only those that will make the largest impact.
- Value can only be created when the things that we have built are being used.
- We measure the value we create by how much it improves the lives of our customers.

## Foster Growth
- Growth happens when an individual continuously asks themselves: is this the best I can do?
- To grow, we must step into conversations that feel scary and uncomfortable.
- To foster the growth of our colleagues—regardless of their job title—we must give them deeply honest feedback, and expect them to do the same for us.
- Feedback is most effective when those receiving it feel supported by those giving it.
- Successes and failures are important because of what we learn from them.

## Honour Time
- We set deadlines to push ourselves to be creative in solving problems.
- Overtime is cheating: Working extra hours short-circuits the time constraint that we've set for ourselves keeps us from being creative.
- Learning and doing are not separate endeavors. Within the time we allocate to a problem, we must account for both the need to deliver a solution and the need to properly learn _how_ to deliver it.
- If we never exceed a timeline, we’ll never know how fast we can actually go.
- If we consistently exceed timelines, we’ll lose the trust of our colleagues and customers.
- Time spent _not working at all_ makes us more effective during the time we spend working.
- A timeline is most motivating when each person doing the work has personally committed to it.
