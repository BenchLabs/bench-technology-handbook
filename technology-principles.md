## Create Value

*Context:*

Our mastery of technology gives us the opportunity to make an impact at scale. We can ship elegant code that is easily maintainable and scales with ease. We can ship interfaces that are incredibly delightful to use. None of it matters unless real people use it and it makes a difference to the quality of their lives. This means we need to ship often with deep empathy with our customers and rigorous processes that ensure we're always working on the most impactful things. It's not about us; it's about the impact we have on the world.

*Axioms:*
- Value creation starts with a commitment to improve the status quo
- Building a thriving business will allow us to help small business owners at scale
- We find our best solutions by working backwards from customer needs
- Rapid iterations create short feedback loops that inform great solutions
- The value we provide for our customers must be worth the effort we request from them
- If we can't measure our impact, we can't assess if we've created value
- Itâ€™s healthy to defer great ideas when our current work has greater impact

## Foster Growth

*Context:*

We've got a [big mission](https://bench.co/go/culture/). To get there, we all need to be _so much better_ than we currently are. Fostering growth starts as an individual activity: no one can grow _for you_! We enhance that individual activity by making growth the number one priority of our management team. This is both a carrot and a stick: if you're taking yourself on, we will do everything we can to create space for your growth, and if you aren't growing, we'll have the tough conversations required to make sure you get back in the saddle.

*Axioms:*
- Growth happens outside of your comfort zone
- Both failure and success are incredible teachers
- Permission to express dissatisfaction + support to drive change = continuous improvement
- Feedback is most effective when those receiving it feel supported by those giving it
- For growth, periods of rest are as essential as periods of effort
- Teaching multiplies the value of your knowledge

## Succeed Together

*Context:*

The work we do is complicated, and requires support from multiple groups with different skill sets. Succeeding together is about leveraging these skills along with our lived experiences to solve problems effectively and in a way that complements the other things happening at Bench. To do this, we need to find the right mix of autonomy and communication coupled with a deep understanding of our business and the customer's needs. This takes a lot of practice to do well, but when we get it right, amazing things can happen.

*Axioms:*
- High performers all share one quality: they make their teams better
- Diverse perspectives and experiences contribute to better outcomes for everyone
- Effective organizations use a small set of objectives to coordinate work across teams
- Social bonds increase empathy, mutual respect, and our ability to do great things
- Context, capability, and trust are all essential for a successful autonomous team
- We are successful in setting timelines when they push us without burning us out
- We break silos and build trust by making our goals, progress, and learnings readily - available and easily digestible
