## Create Value

*Context:*

Our mastery of technology gives us the opportunity to make an impact at scale. We can ship elegant code that is easily maintainable and scales with ease. We can ship interfaces that are incredibly delightful to use. None of it matters unless real people use it and it makes a difference to the quality of their lives. I'll go further: it only matters if _large amounts_ of real people use it and it makes a difference in the quality of their lives. We must keep this in mind in all of our work: it's not about us; it's about the impact we have on the world.

*Supporting Principles:*
- We measure the value we create by how much it improves the lives of our customers.
- The speed at which we learn is the most important factor in our ability to create value.
- We are most likely to do high-value work when we see it as necessary to advance a cause that we believe in.
- We ensure that our work is of high value by nurturing, developing and sharing so many ideas that we can’t possibly do them all, and then choosing only those that will make the largest impact.
- Value can only be created when the things that we have built are being used.

## Foster Growth

*Context:*

We've got a [big mission](https://bench.co/go/culture/). To get there, we all need to be _so much better_ than we currently are. Fostering growth starts as an individual activity—no one can grow for you. We upgrade that individual activity by making growth the number one priority of our management team. This is both a carrot and a stick; if you're taking yourself on, we will do everything we can to create space for your growth, and if you aren't growing, we'll have the tough conversations required to make sure you get back in the saddle.

*Supporting Principles:*
- Growth happens when an individual continuously asks themselves: is this the best I can do?
- To grow, we must step into conversations that feel scary and uncomfortable.  
- To foster the growth of our colleagues—regardless of their job title—we must give them deeply honest feedback, and expect them to do the same for us.
- Feedback is most effective when those receiving it feel supported by those giving it.
- Successes and failures are important because of what we learn from them.
- Individuals are responsible for the impact they have on the people they work with

## Honour Time

*Context:*

Time is the most precious resource we have. This applies at the organizational level and the individual level. By being intentional with the time we assign to our activities, we create an environment where creativity and ingenuity are the drivers of our success, not the time we spend working. This is how we get to be ferociously effective as an organization while also living rich, sustainable lifestyles as individuals.

*Supporting Principles:*
- We set deadlines to push ourselves to be creative in solving problems.
- Overtime is cheating: Working extra hours short-circuits the time constraint that we've set for ourselves, keeping us from being creative.
- Learning and doing are not separate endeavors. Within the time we allocate to a problem, we must account for both the need to deliver a solution and the need to properly learn _how_ to deliver it.
- If we never exceed a timeline, we’ll never know how fast we can actually go.
- If we consistently exceed timelines, we’ll lose the trust of our colleagues and customers.
- Time spent _not working at all_ makes us more effective during the time we spend working.
- A timeline is most motivating when each person doing the work has personally committed to it.
