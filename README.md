# The Bench Technology Organization Handbook

Welcome to the online handbook for the Bench Technology organization! We have created this resource to describe at a high level what we're up to and how we go about doing it.

This is a scrappy, default open resource. We're releasing this imperfect early version because we believe it provides more value in the hands of our team today than a perfect version will 6 months from now. We will continue to iterate on it forever, so keep an eye on those commits!
